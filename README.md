## Overview of PyBer Analysis
PyBer, a large ride-sharing company, is looking to understand the relationship between type of city, number of drivers and riders, and fares from rideshare data, focusing on fare data from January to early May 2019 in particular. This analysis and visualizations of results will be used by the company decision makers to help PyBer improve its accessibility and affordability of ride-sharing to under-served neighborhoods. 

## Results
Total number of rides and drivers are larger as population density increases; in other words, _Rural_ areas have the smallest number of rides (125) and drivers (78) while _Urban_ has the most rides (1,625) and drivers (2,405). 
Total sum of fares across city types add up to ~$64K, for which majority is driven by transactions from _Urban_ areas. Similar to the relationship of city type vs. total number of rides/drivers, the total sum of fares collected in _Urban_ areas (almost $40K) far exceed those of _Suburban_ (about $19K) or _Rural_ (about $4K). 
However, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is most expensive for _Rural_ areas, followed by _Suburban_, then _Urban_. While the more densely populated areas see the most ride-sharing, each ride's price is much cheaper than rural areas which see much fewer rides with higher prices per trip.

On a weekly basis over the time period of Jan-early May 2019, fares typically stay pretty consistent for each city type. The _Rural_ areas typically generate <$500 per week, _Suburban_ areas range from
